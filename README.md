# Keras SqueezeNet

This is a Keras implementation of the lightweight SqueezeNet v1.1. It follows
the same structure as a normal Keras application and much of the code is a
direct port of the `keras.applications.vgg16`.

The model is **pretrained** and weights are included both in this repository
and as a `.h5` file automatically downloaded when instantiating the model. The
weights have been ported from [tf-squeezenet](https://github.com/avoroshilov/tf-squeezenet).
